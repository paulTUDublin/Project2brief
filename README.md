# Introduction 

The second project is "Specialist embedded systems project" (30% of overall grade, threshold of 40%).

Important dates

- Release date: 28MAR2025
- Due date: 25APR2025

Students are to to propose their own project and develop a specialist embedded system that aligns with a chosen sub-discipline.

Learning outcomes that are to be addressed in this project are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

- 3. Evaluate suitable hardware components for an embedded system. 
- 4. Debug an embedded system using hardware and software debugging tools.
- 5. Develop and document elements of a HAL with good documentation procedures
- 6. Work with a source code control system individually or as a member of a team
- 7. Discuss the ethical considerations of embedded systems and their use in Industry 

# Criteria/requirements

From the indicative content and LOs, the following criteria have been created.

- A working project (30%)
	- What was attained by the project, overall aim and objectives.
	- Demonstration of additional functionality e.g. DMA, input capture etc.
- Circuit schematic (10%)
	- Drawn professionally e.g. Kicad or Fritzing (or suitable alternative).
- Software documentation (30%)
	- [Good documentation procedures](https://www.rochester.edu/ohsp/resources/study-documentation/gdp/) and [in the context of embedded systems](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-best-practices-documenting-maintaining-1c), an approach used by the regulated manufacturing industries when documenting factory and site tests. (LO5)
	- GitHub readme file is to be used for main documentation (L06 and L07)
- Testing and results (20%) (L04)
	- Debugging procedures e.g. verifying registers are being updated accordingly using the software debugger or hardware debugging either with a logic analyser or an ad-hoc method like using the GPIO during an interrupt.
	- A clear reasoning for a test that outlines how the test will help debug or verify correct operation.
- Presentation/demonstration (10%)
	- A short video (5 mins max), uploaded to YouTube, that demonstrates that the functionality of the embedded system and any significant features.

# Project schedule

The project is 4 weeks long.
Students are expected to work on their project outside of class time, self-directed learning is part of all modules.
 
# Submission details

The GitHub repository you use for this project should be available to view as this will contain all the relevant details of your project.
For record/evidence keeping, please ensure you upload a ZIP file of the final version of the project.
